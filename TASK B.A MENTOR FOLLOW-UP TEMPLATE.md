# TASK B.A MENTOR FOLLOW-UP TEMPLATE

Subject: Mentorship Confirmation and Follow-up

Dear Ms. Castillo,

I really enjoyed our meeting with you the other week regarding the mentorship position we have for you in **CodePath** and I greatly appreciate you for agreeing to share with our students your insight and expertise into the field of Cybersecurity.

We, at **CodePath**, are very much excited to have you on board for our next 12-week class sessions which will officially ***start this Fall of 2018** ranging from last week of September until the 2nd week of December*. I look forward to talking with you again soon. 

Should you need any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me at tim@codepath.org.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

All the Best,

Tim Lee

CodePath, Co-Founder
